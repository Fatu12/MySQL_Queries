Write the query to select all the names in the database. The columns should appear, even if there are no records in 
the database yet.
    SELECT * 
    FROM my_db.names;
Insert your own name into the database!
    SELECT * 
    FROM my_db.names;
    INSERT INTO my_db.names (name)
    VALUES ("Fatu");

Insert another name or, NINJA BONUS: insert more than one name in a single statement.
    SELECT * FROM my_db.names;
    INSERT INTO my_db.names (name)
    VALUES ("Fatu"),
          ("Brenda"),
          ("Mariya");
Optional: Try creating, updating and deleting records using the statements you've learn about.
    updating:
        SELECT * FROM my_db.names;
        UPDATE  my_db.names
        SET name = "Jenny"
        WHERE id = 3;
    deleting:
        SELECT * FROM my_db.names;
        DELETE 
        FROM my_db.names
        WHERE id = 4;
